Of all places where I can find an inspiring paragraph for me to move forward, I read them in [Cracked Humor Site](http://www.cracked.com):

> Turns out the most valuable thing you gain from making something is the experience of making it. You can use that experience to make more, better things, and whether you're looking for a creative career or just the emotional fulfillment of making something awesome, you're further down the road now than you were then.
