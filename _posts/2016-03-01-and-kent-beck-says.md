In Test Driven Development (TDD), Kent Beck's mantra is:

1. Make it Work
2. Make it Right
3. Make it Fast

##### Make it Work
Create test cases against the interface that I want to build, complete with mentioning the actual and expected results. Deliver the code early with something that works.

##### Make it Right
Continue by going back to the working code and make it right. Use the existing test set to make sure it still works

#### Make it Fast
Optimize the "Right" codes and use the test set to make sure it still works right
