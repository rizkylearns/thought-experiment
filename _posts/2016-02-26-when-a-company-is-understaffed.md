Here is an idea. When I am in an organization that needs to accomplish lots of things and its goal outnumbers its resources, I get creative. I will approach this in terms of what I know, or pretty much what I just read recently that may seem irrelevant. Usually once I learn something or read something, no matter how irrelevant, I can apply them to solve a problem. I will do this again now; solving this organizational problem using what I just learned about functional programming.

I am still getting familiarized with functional programming. By risking myself to get everything wrong about functional programming and how ridiculously impossible to implement my idea, here goes anyway:

I first will put aside all of the job positions and designations that my organization seemingly must put into structure. What is left is job functions that are usually put to describe these job positions and designations. This will give me a focus in what functions, their inputs, and outputs are upfron than scratching my head to put each of my organization member a designation. No, I am not saying that my team members will not have a designation, because they will, but I would rather want to get to the point of what I can produce out of my understaffed organization.
Like writing user story, I am making up a common template for each function that I need: 

"My responsibility is *[to do something]* by working with *[whom I respond]* and *[what tool I use]* to produce *[what are the expected results of my action]* so that *[I can fulfill the reason why I need to do it]*."

I will put some entries based on what I will try to implement in a near future at work:

| Function | Tag Set | Name Set | Module A | Module B |
| :------: | :-----: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| My responsibility is to create a playbook by working with my teammates for their continuous feedback to produce a clear and concise strategy and guideline to reach the existing short-term and long-term organization goals so that my teammates and my team stakeholders have an acceptable level of clarity on the scope of work and authority of their role in a project and task || [Gaia, Hermes, Ares] | [Gaia] | [Ares] |
| My responsibility is to create team expansion strategies by working with the Human Resources to help me collecting candidates to produce a set of tools usable to search, shortlist, and accept potential team members || [Icarus, Apollo, Zeus] | [Apollo] | [Icarus] |
| My responsibility is to respond to product support inquiries over identified issues by working with my other support team members to produce a resolution to the inquiry so that I can have a clear understanding and actually solve the enquired problem in a short-term or long-term fashion, whichever suitable || [Apollo, Nike, Hercules] | [Apollo] | [Hercules] |
| My responsibility is to provide feedback over incidents and cases to be observed for and evaluated with the existing organization strategy by working with my superior and their peers to produce a clear picture of the current execution state of the existing strategy and to treat these observations as managerial decision tools || [Pandora, Gaia, Aphrodite] | [?] | [Gaia] |

I have added the Function column first. This enforces the notion that I am forming the work of my organization members based on the required functions, not based on what their designations are, or at least not initially. I then relate each function to a set of designations and/or job position to *tag* the functions to terms that my team members are familiar with. The more I learn that some positions match with a function, the more *tags* I can insert.

The next step requires a little more social orientation among my team members; I must enter a set of member names for each function for who is the likely member who is capable of taking the specified input and action, and to produce the desired output(s). Depending on how understaffed I am, the names will most likely repeat over many rows, but that is ok. It is also ok that I will not fulfill the entire Module column with a set of names on every function. This could mean a few possibilities. One is that such function is not required for the module. Another possibility is that it is permissible to defer the function of this module to its next phase of execution, to allow other modules to finish up first while ensuring the module with absent function actor to partially produce some output where the actors do exist.

*ps: I will keep coming back to this post whenever I can come up with another function and another set of Greek Gods*
