Here is an idea. When I am in an organization that needs to accomplish lots of things and its goal outnumbers its resources, I get creative. I will approach this in terms of what I know, or pretty much what I just read recently that may seem irrelevant. Usually once I learn something or read something, no matter how irrelevant, I can apply them to solve a problem. I will do this again now; solving this organizational problem using what I just learned about functional programming.
I am still getting familiarized with functional programming. By risking myself to get everything wrong about functional programming and how ridiculously impossible to implement my idea, here goes anyway:
I first will put aside all of the job positions and designations that my organization seemingly must put into structure. What is left is job functions that are usually put to describe these job positions and designations. This will give me a focus in what functions, their inputs, and outputs are upfron than scratching my head to put each of my organization member a designation. No, I am not saying that my team members will not have a designation, because they will, but I would rather want to get to the point of what I can produce out of my understaffed organization.
Like writing user story, I am making up a common template for each function that I need: "My responsibility is <to do something> by working with <whom I respond> and <what tool I use> to produce <what are the expected results of my action> so that <I can fulfill the reason why I need to do it>."
I will put some entries based on what I will try to implement in a near future at work:
---
My responsibility is to create a playbook by working with my teammates for their continuous feedback to produce a clear and concise strategy and guideline to reach the existing short-term and long-term organization goals so that my teammates and my team stakeholders have an acceptable level of clarity on the scope of work and authority of their role in a project and task
---
My responsibility is to create team expansion strategies by working with the Human Resources to help me collecting candidates to produce a set of tools usable to search, shortlist, and accept potential team members
---
My responsibility is to respond to product support inquiries over identified issues by working with my other support team members to produce a resolution to the inquiry so that I can have a clear understanding and actually solve the enquired problem in a short-term or long-term fashion, whichever suitable
---
My responsibility is to provide feedback over incidents and cases to be observed for and evaluated with the existing organization strategy by working with my superior and their peers to produce a clear picture of the current execution state of the existing strategy and to treat these observations as managerial decision tools
