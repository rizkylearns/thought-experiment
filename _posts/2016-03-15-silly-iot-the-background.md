I would like to see if I can create an overly simplified system of IoT, or M2M, or whatever the name kids put these days, into a small implementation.

I will use my project-hydra to realize these thoughts. In the end, I expect to have a fully working TCP/IP server, using a simple binary protocol socket message, to store simulated GPS data.

I have some prior knowledge with IoT development and without jeopardizing my current work i.e. without copying over things here, I want to make up my own system. 

It is a concept worth proving and it feels liberating.
