Here is an idea. When I am in a position when peers, customers or colleagues, ask the kind of question "So, Rizky, when can this thing be done? Can you tell me now/yesterday/next week?", my first reaction is usually "Are you serious?". Ever since I came to meet a more "sophisticated" group of people, and demonstrated how work can get organized (and done), I realized there's another reaction I can use. After all, it's not always their intention to corner me into answering such question. When they don't, I think what they really after is, well, as the title says, an estimation. It depends on who I talk to, an estimation could be used as a critical decision too; one being whether or not the project work should go ahead or whether I will get paid.

So how can a work estimate be so helpful? For one, the number I showed gives a certain level of confidence, certainty, and clarity to hold on to and make a projection to... a project. If I tell someone that this work will take a week, then I am conveying a message that I will commit to complete the work I estimated up to a week. A customer can gauge whether a week for completing a task is worth doing. 

One problem still remains. I have experienced when an estimation is used to evaluate my work quality and competence. When it passes one week that I committed earlier, my position will be in jeopardy. I get such remarks in a line of "I thought you are competent enough to tell me that this thing will be done in a week. So? it's been a week, it's not done yet! You, Rizky, are not suitable for the work". I most likely have overestimated the required work, but the hell knows for sure if it will take a week to do in the first place? Even with the most sophisticated work breakdowns and requirement details, there is always a parasite that will inevitably send me backwards, be that poor understanding to the task, or technical debts, or most commonly, and the people I work with who have an agenda to bring me down, be that inadvertently or on purpose. Be that as it may, I still have to give somebody a work estimate.

So, the idea. I have created a spreadsheet where I am confident that can produce a "good enough" work estimate that I can give whomever interested in my answer my number. I base my single value based on a few criteria:
- Rizky's productivity factor: For every one hour of work done, allow half an hour for distractions and deep thoughts.
- Asymptote-al increase of productivity when an additional team member is added. There will be a diminishing return at some point, but two heads are better than none at all.
- Complexity based weight values. For a highly complex task, when the task is a design, it has higher weight than a trivial implementation. How can I determine this complexity value and weight? I use my deep product knowledge from business and system perspectives as well as experience 

At the end of the day, [this sheet]({{ site.url }}/docs/Work_Estimation.xlsx) has helped me once when I realized this idea and I will try it again and possibly refine it too. 

How much clarity is needed before I can unleash a number of work estimate? It is relative to how much time I am allowed to create the estimate. If I am given one week to put an estimate, my number will be one week worth of estimation work. If I am given 3 weeks to estimate, then it will be worth 3 weeks of estimation work. The more time I am given, the more time I can use to better understand the required tasks. I have to always leave a room for improvement and better clarity, so I do not ned to get all of the required tasks as clear as possible from the get-go, just as long as it is good enough for me to start something, be that a product concept or another discussion, I can get my number "better".
