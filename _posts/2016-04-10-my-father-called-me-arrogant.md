I just came back from my family holiday to Indonesia. I met my dad, and that on its own was a blissfully special occasion for me. I did not have a close relationship with my dad until recently. I was spoiled and ungrateful. I still am, but I am a bit better now.
I spoke with him about work. I told him everything I said and done recently. 

The only remark that he gave me is that he said I am arrogant. That hurt my ego a little.

I spoke loud to anyone and everyone. I felt that I had nothing else to lose. I felt that I had to let them out, but the way I talked to my colleagues and the things that I said, my dad quickly saw me that I am arrogant and I think I am better than the people I work with.

I started my career following my dad’s advice: “Whatever you do, be honest and have a good work etiquette”. I based all of my works on this advice alone. I realize it’s much harder to this simple task and it is much easier to be “bad”. 

When he said that I am arrogant, I must look harder at what I have said and done in the past month. It was never my intention to be that way, to show that I am better than the rest, but it is easily interpreted to be one. “Even when I acknowledge my own flaws to people?” I thought, but that didn’t matter much. 

Here’s an idea. I will use a different approach to the same goal. Many ways to skin a lamb. If my last approach is no good, then try another approach that I think is better.
