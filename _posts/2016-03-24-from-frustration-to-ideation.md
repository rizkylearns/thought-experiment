It is amazing how much impact a power struggle can cause in an organization. I could make it sound hilarious but it is not, it plays with people's quality of lives and, while it turns out really for some, it came to devastating outcome for others. 
Humans are natural egotists. When it comes down to an organization level ego-warfare, we steal people and ideas, we divide and confuse others, we do countless self promotions, anything that can help us to climb that corporate level. 
Brilliant people do these things while idiots sit back and cringe on the realization that they are already deep in the black hole.  
I can be frustrated when I realize I work with these brilliant people. I'm an idiot. Somebody told me once that engineers work from behind the curtains. Nobody knows that you built that bridge but you do. You know that people travel, meet their families and friends, by using the bridge you built. You walk away with that sense of satisfaction and pride and then you move on to build a bigger and better bridge. I'm an idiot to stay behind the curtain while the superstars keep me occupied with a truckload of nonsense to keep me off balance and, well, stay behind the curtains.

I am an idiot and I am frustrated. But here's an idea.

I channel these frustration energy and into a barrage of ideas and crafting those ideas. I am already in the blackhole. While crafting these ideas may not take me out of the blackhole, but it surely will make my unpleasant stay more enjoyable.
