I miss my traveling days. My wife, before we settled in with our newborn, took me to a lot of worldwide adventures. At some point, we ended up in Ethiopia.
Ethiopia was the first African land I ever stepped on. I was humbled, intimidated, and curious by the adventure.
Maschutu, or whichever correct name for the little girl who walked with us in one of our treks, gave me an inspiration. She was a little local girl who lived at the village that we passed by in our Ethiopian adventure. Full of spirit and smile. That's odd for me. Unlike her, I don't remember the last time I have to worry about whether I can eat on that day. And I still complain and whine about my life. Maschutu, on the other hand, was not vengeful towards her life. She was so full of energy and she told me and my wife repeatedly "When you come back here you remember Maschutu!". She did not beg for my money or food. Somehow I see her source of happiness is herself. I felt I have wasted a great deal of my life focusing on complaints and daydreams instead of putting energy to do or create something useful for myself and for the people around me. Materials are tools for greatness, not destinations to seek after.
