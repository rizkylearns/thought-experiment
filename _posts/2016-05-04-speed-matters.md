## Speed Matters 

If I could choose a one word mantra to have a product in technology, I choose **SPEED**.

Speed is the ultimate measurement unit for every aspect of a technology-oriented product along with everything and everyone that surrounds it.

I am not only talking about the likes of a product performance where "Google Search wins over Yahoo because it gives me faster result" edge of technology. This aspect covers the product's performance, and when Google continuously put an emphasis on speed by strategically produce numerous upgrades from code, to infrastructure, to decision making, and to whatever means that support this, it wins the heart of users in adopting its product and it now becomes an ubiquitous word for searching information through all corners of the web. 

To have a product, I must deal with many aspects that surrounds it: The people who build it, the people who ask for it, the people who make sure what is built is what is asked, the tools to build it, the tools to maintain it, the people who use it, the methods to do all of the above, and many more.

### Speed in Product Performance

I don't go too far to make an example of this aspect than Google. The company's products have strong affinity to speed. I get the results I want in less than half a second, from anywhere around the world. I get hints for what I am searching for. I can get the email I wanted in a matter of a few or less clicks/gestures. I can easily work with the files that I saved. Easy is the result of putting an emphasis on speed in product performance. It is a qualitative measure that ensures I keep using Google product in my lifetime.

### Speed in Information Access

Information is what drives my decision making in my daily life or business. The faster I can access the information I need, the faster I can make a decision: to know something, to do something, to grow a business, to get somewhere.

Sharing knowledge among team members speeds up productivity growth over time; they know, they care, they can help.

Telling a user that the information they are looking for is "right there in no click or a few clicks away" gives them the feel of a "useful tech that I want to invest my time and money in". 

### Speed in Research and Development

Building a thing fast usually means that I know what I am doing; I can quickly gain access of the information I need to create something.

It can also mean that I am using the right toolset for the job. The technology stack that I am using facilitates me with frameworks, libraries, and resources that I can use to get the job done fast. It may provide a useful set of systematic checks and balances e.g. automated tests framework, code coverage analysis, etc, to help me to get the job done, fast.

It can also mean that the analyses done to the thing I want to build are clear and I can do something with a clear and conscious mindset; clear enough that it gives me the feeling that I am fully aware of what I am doing. I can simplify the design around my work. The simpler the solution, the better the indicator that I understand what I am doing. I believe the saying goes: 

> Perfection is achieved when there is nothing else to add but when there is nothing else to take away.

It can also mean that I am using the right method set perform my research and development. I make it work, I make it right, I make it fast. I observe, I orient, I decide, I act, and I go back to observe, orient, decide, act, and the loop goes on. It is fast. It is efficient.

### Speed in Analytics

Observation and orientation steps are always required to continuously evaluate what I am doing. 

The better the analytical toolset, the faster I can make an analysis of my product.

The faster I can access information about my product, the faster I can analyze.

The faster I can analyze, the faster I can make conscious decisions and act on them.

### Speed in Delivery

I want to deliver my product fast. Users never wait. Speed gives them a great deal of satisfaction over our commitment to the collaboration between myself as a producer and them as consumers.

### Speed in Maintenance and Problem Solving

The faster I know about a problem my product is facing, the faster I can solve them.

The better the method I can use to continously maintain my product, the faster I can gain confidence over its qualitative values (stability, consistency, performance)

### Speed in Expanding

Products usually evolve. But Products should revolve. Team members should support the revolution of products without sacrificing their "perfection". The faster the number of people increases, the faster the products can revolve. To raise the number of people is not simply by employing an entire village; doing this will clearly show that I don't know what I am doing. The more I understand who I need, the better my selection criteria become (even though sometimes it is a gamble). The better my selection criteria, the faster I can recruit. The better my initiation methods, the faster I can add productivity level over the number of people I recruit.

## Speed is The Ultimate Measure

Making a hasty decision is not speedy; it's reckless. Recklessness is the evil twin of Speed. To measure every aspect around a tech product, I must make sure that I am measuring by speed and not recklessness. With speed, I can go faster. With recklessness, I can tumble down faster.
