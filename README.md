## Thought Experiment ##

Ideas, if not  realized, are nothing but air. I have spent years jotting down my ideas in my trusty scrapbook.
I want to share with the world ideas that are worth sharing, starting from my own.
Writing these ideas on Github is one step closer to their reality.
I will not abandon my scrapbook. No. I could blog with the likes of Jekyll, but using the right tool, Jekyll or not, will come later as this repo evolves. I start simple and see how it goes.
