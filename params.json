I have spent years jotting down my ideas in my trusty scrapbook.\r\nI want to share with the world ideas that are worth sharing, starting from my own.\r\nWriting these ideas on Github is one step closer to their reality.\r\nI will not abandon my scrapbook. No. I could blog with the likes of Jekyll, but using the right tool, Jekyll or not, will come later as this repo evolves. I start simple and see how it goes.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
